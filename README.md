# golem
Experimental crawler using Scrapy and Selenium

**NOTE: Highly likely to not work or change unexpectedly!!!**

# Introduction

Inspired by [Brozzler](https://github.com/internetarchive/brozzler), [Memento Tracer](http://tracer.mementoweb.org/) and [WebRecorder Autopilot](https://guide.webrecorder.io/autopilot/), this is an attempt to build a scalable crawler that can be 'trained' by general users in order to interact properly with complex websites.

This prototype is built on [Selenium](https://selenium.dev/), [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [warcprox](https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox).

# Workflow

## Current Workflow

Users can install the [Selenium IDE](https://selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) browser plugin to create and test macros that interact with 'difficult' pages.  The goal here is to ensure all necessary dynamic dependencies within one page are revealed, rather than attempting to crawl the site.

These macros can be saved and maintained as [SIDE](https://selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/getting-started#save-your-work) files, and [exported as Python `pytest` code](https://selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/code-export#python-pytest).

The Python code is then used to create suitable code to run in a Scrapy crawler (by hand, but see [below](#future-workflow)). This spider talks to [Selenium Grid](https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/) via the [scrapy-headless](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-headless) model.  The web browsers that serve the Selenium Grid are configured to use warcprox as a web proxy, and therefore every request and response the browsers make will be captured in a WARC file.

The rest of the crawler workflow (enqueuing and de-duping URLs, scope, robots.txt etc.) is all just the standard Scrapy stuff.

## Future Workflow

The recent work on Selenium IDE offers a couple of way things could be made easier in the future.

Firstly, the new SIDE file format is a fairly simple scripting language, quite similar to that proposed by the Memento Tracer project.  There is already a [standalone command-line runner](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/command-line-runner/) for these files, and others have already made [some progress](https://github.com/side-runner-py/side-runner-py/issues/49) on a [Python implementation](https://github.com/side-runner-py/side-runner-py).

Therefore, in the future we many be able to use SIDE executor from within a larger crawler rather than manually porting the code.  Some conventions would have to be established around the format so the same macro could be run on different pages and integrate with the main crawl engine, but this should be workable.  However, the [SIDE language](https://selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands) is quite complex and [still growing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/issues/182) so it's not clear how much work this will entail.

The second option comes from the fact that the Selenium IDE already support exporting tests as Python code.  The [code for the Python `pytest` exporter](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/tree/v3/packages/code-export-python-pytest/src) could be extended or adapted to emit Python code that the Scrapy crawler could invoke directly rather than being manually translated.  As with the previous option, some additional conventions would be required to store the SIDE files and associate them with the sites they can be used on, but with that in place, a standard build process (similar to [this](https://gist.github.com/varunnayak26/708f5d7e2c5c4b8db61a7a5a4a2a760f)) could create the python modules we need.

As the `pytest` export already exists, this second option is probably the most likely to work in the near term. It's also the easiest in terms of permitting co-existence between manually-created and SIDE-derived crawler modules within one codebase.

# Running the crawler.

You need a suitable Selenium Grid instance, e.g. for development:

    cd golem
    docker-compose up -d

Then you can run the crawler:

    cd golem
    export SELENIUM_GRID_URL="http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"
    scrapy crawl sounds.bl.uk



# Example of SIDE output

This is an example of the `pytest` code the current SIDE exporter produces:
